## How to Add Content

### Adding a New Friendship Scene

1. Create file: `story/companions/{companion_id}_level_{N}.json`
2. Write dialogue using template format
3. Reference images you'll generate
4. Game automatically loads when friendship increases

### Adding More Enemies

1. Modify `setup_wave()` in [scripts/shmup_game.gd](scripts/shmup_game.gd)
2. Adjust `enemies_remaining` and `spawn_interval`
3. Can add different enemy types with new scenes

### Modifying Companion Bonuses

Edit [scripts/game_manager.gd:14-43](scripts/game_manager.gd#L14-L43):
- Change `stat_bonus` to affect different stat
- Modify `bonus_per_level` for balance
- Adjust combat bonuses in [scripts/shmup_game.gd:33-50](scripts/shmup_game.gd#L33-L50)

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Intro plays through completely
- [ ] Hub presents companion choices
- [ ] Each companion selection works
- [ ] Solo path works
- [ ] Dungeon minigame is playable
- [ ] Victory returns to hub and increases friendship
- [ ] Failure makes companion unavailable
- [ ] Solo path death = game over
- [ ] Stats update correctly
- [ ] Friendship scenes trigger at right levels
- [ ] All 3 companions can reach level 10
- [ ] Ending triggers when all maxed

## Balance Notes

**Current balance is placeholder!** Adjust these based on playtesting:

- Enemy health (currently 30)
- Player base damage (currently 10 + STR/2)
- Spawn rates
- Companion bonuses (currently +50% for Kara/Miko, +30% for Sarah)
- Friendship gain rate (currently 1 per successful run = 10 runs per companion)

Total runs needed: **30 successful runs minimum** (10 per companion)

Consider: Should friendship increase by 2 on later runs? Should there be friendship decay?

**Start by generating the intro images, then test the intro sequence!**
